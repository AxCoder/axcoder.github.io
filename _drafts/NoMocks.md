## What are mocks

Different people mean different under, mock, here I will use the following definition:

> Mock is a [test double](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html), that is specific to particular test and does not fully 
> implement contract of a dependency

For example, you can implement only a subset of methods that are used in tests, or not full behavior of a dependency.
